# Bridge Troubleshooting

The OpenSwap bridge is a user interface build on top of the Harmony Horizon bridge.  All transactions are processed through the Harmony Horizon bridge.  If you attempted to bridge tokens and have not received the tokens in your wallet please note the following:\
\
•Bridge transactions can take up to 45 minutes.

• Did you add the token address to your wallet to make sure it is visible.\

•If you still did not receive your tokens after 45 minutes, check you transaction on the bridge explorer. https://bridge.harmony.one/explorer

•If it shows that there was an error, contact bridge@harmony.one with one of the transaction ids. If one of the transactions is locked, they can resolve the issue. Please do not reach out to them prior to 45 minutes since the initial transaction.
