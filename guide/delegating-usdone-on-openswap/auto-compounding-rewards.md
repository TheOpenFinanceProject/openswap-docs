# Auto-Compounding Rewards



OpenSwap grants you the ability to compound your $ONE rewards directly into an OpenX LP and have it staked automatically! This exact process will happen every hour.&#x20;

Let’s dive into the details. Our smart contracts will take 50% of the $ONE rewards generated and market purchase $OpenX. The smart contracts then use the other 50% of your $ONE rewards and purchase a token the end user selected on OpenSwap. The two tokens will be used to create LP tokens and automatically staked on the OpenSwap farm. That is a lot work from some amazing smart contracts!

### **Setup auto-compounding LPs**&#x20;

You must be a delegator to the OpenSwap validator. The OpenX 20% APY node validator is the only Harmony validator that allows you to auto-compound your rewards directing into staked LP farms. You can stake your $ONE tokens on the harmony staking site or through OpenSwap.

**STEP 1:** Go to Openswap.one \*\*Confirm your Harmony Browser wallet selected is connected to the site. Staking is not available with MetaMask at this time\*\* \
**STEP 2:** Click on ‘Farm’ in the menu \
**STEP 3:** Click ‘Details’ on the ‘OpenX Node 20% APY’\
**STEP 4:** Click ‘Settings’\
**STEP 5:** Under the ‘Set Compounding Farm’ area, find the farm you would like to have your rewards converted into and click ‘Select’\
**STEP 6:** A popup will appear from the Harmony Browser Wallet. Enter any security information required. Click ‘Approve’ \
**STEP 7:** Click ‘Confirm and Sign’



### **Change the current auto-compounding LP selection**

To change the current LP you are auto-compounding into is rather simple. Navigate to the OpenX Node 20% APY validator in the OpenSwap farm. Under the settings area, click the ‘Select’ button for the new OpenX LP you would like to receive.&#x20;



### Resetting back to normal rewards distribution

If you determine you no longer want to auto-compound your rewards, click the ‘Reset’ button across from the ‘Set Compounding Farm’



### Available LPs for auto-compounding

The following liquidity pools are available for auto compounding:\
OpenX / ONE\
