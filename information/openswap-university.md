# OpenSwap University

Have you considered branching out into decentralized finance on the Harmony network but donâ€™t know where to begin? The barriers of entry for DeFi can be significant for new users. To simplify the process, we created a series of introductory articles for those starting out. The series is called OpenSwap University and will focus on assisting people in their DeFi journey on Harmony and OpenSwap.

_Why Harmony?_ How about 2 second transactions that cost a fraction of a penny. For newcomers to the DeFi world, it allows you to play around with transactions and waste a portion of your portfolio just on fees. &#x20;

_Why OpenSwap?_ It is a decentralized exchange that focuses on security, a unique elegant design, and lucrative farming.
