# FAQ

### What is OpenSwap?&#x20;

OpenSwap is a decentralized exchange on Harmony blockchain. Similar to Sushiswap, OpenSwap relies on UniswapV2 contracts for pairs and trades.

### Why OpenSwap?&#x20;

OpenSwap is a community-driven, simple, fast, and secure place to trade and earn. Whether you are on the Harmony, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain networks, OpenSwap gives you easy to use and powerful tools to take full advantage of what DeFi has to offer.&#x20;

### What is The Open Finance Project?

The OpenFinance Project is a DeFi project that aims to merge everyday banking and finance applications and the Harmony Blockchain, including NFC payments and wallet accounts in a simpler and more manageable way.&#x20;

### Who made OpenSwap?

My name is Alex, and I am a blockchain developer. Welcome to the OpenSwap family.&#x20;

### How do I contact the Developer?&#x20;

Telegram chat is the wei.  [https://t.me/OpenSwap\_Harmony](https://t.me/OpenSwap\_Harmony)

### What is the OpenSwap V1 token address (oSwap)?

OpenSwap's V1 token, oSwap, was retired during the V2 migration to OpenX.  The migration was a 1:1 exchange that took place in October of 2021. The token address for oSwap was: 0xc0431Ddcc0D213Bf27EcEcA8C2362c0d0208c6DC.&#x20;

### Why Harmony?&#x20;

When I found out a blockchain with 2s transaction speed and sub-cent fees existed, there was no doubt in my mind that this would be the perfect place to create a decentralized exchange.&#x20;

### Which wallets are supported?&#x20;

Currently, Metamask and Harmony One are supported on OpenSwap.

### How much should I expect to pay in transaction fees?&#x20;

Transaction fees in comparison to Ethereum are incredibly low; trades and spending approvals cost less than 1/1000th of a cent.&#x20;

### Which tokens are available to trade?

Lists of available tokens for each of the chains are available in the tokens tab. They are organized per blockchain. Contract addresses are also available.&#x20;

### What is a Liquidity Pool?&#x20;

In DeFi, a liquidity pool is a pairing of two tokens, locked into a smart contract, that provides liquidity for those tokens on the OpenSwap exchange.

### What is a Liquidity Provider?&#x20;

Liquidity Providers are users who provide two assets/tokens to a Liquidity Pool, locking them into a pair through a smart contract. They’re the lifeblood of a DEX, allowing for there to be enough of a particular pair of assets to be traded. &#x20;

### How do I buy a Token?&#x20;

To buy a token, simply go to the ‘Exchange’ tab and select the token you are using as payment as the upper Token and the token you wish to purchase as the lower token, then approve the trade.

### How do I get a Token Listed?

To get a token listed you must submit the proposition and users will vote whether it is added or not. &#x20;

### What is the Bridge used for?&#x20;

The Bridge is being developed and maintained by the Harmony Core developer team. It is able to migrate tokens from the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains so that users can take advantage of Harmony’s 2 second finality, decentralization, and low transaction fees.&#x20;

### How do I get started?

To get started earning on OpenSwap, bridging Ethereum and Binance tokens would be the first way to go. Users can then add liquidity in the liquidity tab by selecting two tokens. From there you will start earning your share of 0.15% out of 0.30% off of every trade executed on the exchange. To earn the other 0.15%, simply stake your liquidity tokens in the ‘Stake’ tab. Staking your liquidity tokens will earn you OpenSwap tokens which you can either sell or add to liquidity pools again in order to compound your earnings.

### What is Staking?

In general, staking is locking a token and earning rewards for providing that token. In DeFi, staking allows you to earn governance tokens/fee collecting tokens in order to earn revenue for giving users the ability to trade (providing liquidity).&#x20;

### What is OpenSwap’s Max supply?

There is no max supply for OpenSwap. A steady issuance of 12,000,000 tokens yearly are distributed to liquidity providers. Inflation is offset by a burn mechanism.&#x20;

### How many OpenSwap tokens are Minted every year?

12,000,000 tokens are minted annually through distribution to liquidity providers as an incentive to keep liquidity in the pools.

### What were the original Dev wallet tokenomics?&#x20;

The current dev wallet tokenomics are listed under the OpenX tokenomics page.  Originally, the development team would get 20% of the total supply for the first 5 years. 5 year issuance = 14,400,000.  With V2, OpenSwap lowered the dev wallet percentage to 12.5%, thus an even greater percentage of the minted tokens will be distributed to the general public.

### Should I buy OpenSwap tokens?&#x20;

Though you can, during the first 2 weeks of phase 1, buying the token is not recommended. You may cause the price to fluctuate greatly since only a small amount of liquidity will be made available in those pools.&#x20;

### There was an error, what should I do?

Read the troubleshooting guide first and then contact us via the telegram chat. Beware of scammers: the team will never contact you first, and we will never ask for your private keys or mnemonics.&#x20;

### Why doesn't a pool exist?&#x20;

You get this error when no one has supplied liquidity to that given pool. Try finding another pair in the event that this happens.&#x20;

### How do I create a Liquidity Pool?

Creating a pool is pretty straightforward. Simply choose the amounts yourself.&#x20;

Start with a small amount with a ratio of 1:X.XXX

X.XXX corresponds to the price of token 2 in relation to token 1

Ex: USD:BTC&#x20;

1 usd = 0.00002 BTC

So start with a ratio of 1:0.000002.

Add more liquidity after setting the price to avoid setting incorrect prices. You should also check that price stayed the same between multiple additions if liquidity.

### What is Uniswap?

Uniswap is the pioneer in terms of decentralized exchanges and automated market makers. Without Uniswap, there would be no Sushi, Pancake, Mochi, Viper, or OpenSwap.&#x20;

### What is a decentralized application?&#x20;

A decentralized application is a piece of software that manages and executes pre-programmed functions by communicating with a blockchain. Decentralized applications, or “dApps”, use smart contracts to serve as the core logic of an application with built-in rules and parameters.

### What is decentralized finance?&#x20;

Decentralized finance is the blanket term for any financial services, applications, or instruments that are not governed or controlled by any centralized authority. DeFi leverages the ability of cryptocurrencies to use smart contracts to manage and execute the various functions of a traditional government or financial institution, without those - or any - authorities present. DeFi is the world of financial products and functions ruled by code not people.

### What are the risks?&#x20;

Like any investment, DeFi has associated risks. All cryptocurrencies and their associated products, including exchanges (DEX & CEX), are vulnerable to technological errors, financial losses, and security risks.\
\
Technological Risks - Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and exchanges are all built and fueled by code. While not common, all computer technologies run the risk of errors that can result in the temporary or permanent loss of funds. It’s important for any DeFi user to invest wisely, start small, and ensure all products do not have severe glitches or technological errors.\
\
Financial Losses - No different than with any investments, it is possible for tokens or other crypto assets to experience significant loss. This is the most common risk associated with DeFi, as many tokens are susceptible to depreciating in value. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.&#x20;

Security Risks - Every smart contract holding funds has a risk of being hacked. In order to minimize risk, we use forked code from Uniswap v2 because it is some of the most audited and user-tested pieces of code on the internet. However, our specific contracts have not been audited yet and we are working to get that as soon as possible.  Security issues in the crypto space don't only happen with smart contracts, centralized exchanges have regulatory and centralization risks.  Being aware of risks is an important aspect to consider in all digital financial products.&#x20;

### What is impermanent loss?&#x20;

Impermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool and the price of your deposited assets as they relate to each other changes compared to when you deposited them.&#x20;

It is the difference in the ratio of the value between your two tokens when you paired them for liquidity vs when you withdraw them back. This is mostly temporary and only referred to as “loss” when you withdraw and would have gained more value holding the token instead of pairing it in a liquidity pool.
