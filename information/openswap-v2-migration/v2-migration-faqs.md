# V2 Migration FAQs

**What do I have to do now? Should I unstake right now? Should I wait until version 2 to stake?**\
At this time, you will continue on as normal with version 1. There is no risk to your tokens. Please continue to use OpenSwap and farm as normal. Further communication will be made available on all social media platforms about the process to migrate and what actions are needed by the end user.

**When is Version 2 coming?**\
There is a lot of work being done to transition to Version 2. The initial goal was to complete the work in 3–4 weeks; putting it around the end of Oct 2021 / beginning of Nov 2021. At this time, that schedule still remains. &#x20;

**Will the tokenomics be changing?**\
No. The tokenomics will remain the same as V1

**Why are you creating a version 2?**\
OpenSwap had an audit that noted a security issue that falls solely on trusting the developer of the project. The project is still safe as it ever was. Alex, creator and developer of OpenSwap, wants to remove any doubt from this project. The new version 2 will remove any significant defects found by the audit and will be 100% rug-free.&#x20;

**When the time comes, what will I need to do?**\
There will be 2 things you’ll need to do as a Liquidity Provider: unstake everything and break all LP tokens. At that point you can bridge all your OpenSwap tokens. The bridge will be set up to allow you to exchange V1 tokens for v2 tokens without changing price.&#x20;

**What is the ratio of new Version 1 to Version 2?**\
It is a 1:1 ratio; no matter the amount of tokens. There will also be no limit to exchange your V1 tokens

**When we farming begin on Version 2?**\
When migration starts, rewards for V1 will be cut off. We’ll start normal issuance of v2 after more than half of Liquidity is migrated over.&#x20;

**What happens to the old version 1 tokens?**\
Alex will renounce the ownership of V1 MasterChef therefore stopping issuance of V1 OpenSwap tokens forever. OpenSwap will also no longer be able to add farms on V1. Everything will be on V2 from that time.

**When will the new version be audited?**\
Audits of Version 2 will be completed before migration starts.&#x20;

**What will Version 2 be called?**\
At this time, the new token ticker is still to be determined.

**This sounds really difficult / I am scared of all of this…help?**\
There will be very detailed instructions with pictures to guide you through the entire process. This will be over communicated to the community to make sure it is a smooth transition.

**I delegate to the 15% / 100% OpenSwap validator, is there anything I need to do?**\
Yes and No. Any existing Version 1 tokens will need to be migrated over. Once Version 2 is live, any new tokens sent to your wallet will be version 2.
